        <p>
          The Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (Isis) is
          a specialized image processing package. It has many standard
          image processing operations such as contrast stretch, image
          algebra, filters, and statistical analysis. Isis operates on both
          classical two-dimensional images as well as three-dimensional
          cubes collected from imaging spectrometers.  The real power of 
          Isis, however, is its unique 
          capabilities for processing data from NASA spacecraft missions
          such as Voyager, Viking, Galileo, Mars Global Surveyor,
          and Mars Odyssey.

          There are three major functions which must exist in order to
          process EDR images (Experimental Data Records) for a particular
          mission. The first is the ability to ingest or convert the EDR
          into an Isis image.  The second is to calibrate
          the raw DNs (e.g. number from 0 to 255) by converting them to
          radiance or some other planetophysical property.  Finally,
          a camera/sensor model must be developed in order to convert
          the images in raw camera geometry to a usable map projection.

        <p>
          Once the software for ingestion, calibration, and camera models
          are in place, a large suite of cartography programs can be
          utilized.  These programs allow for digital mosaicking of
          adjacent EDRs, photometric modeling and normalization,
          removal of systematic noise patterns, overlaying graticules,
          and numerous other cartographic and scientific analysis functions.
