        The cartographic and scientific processing of planetary image
        data has a long history within the USGS Astrogeology Program.
        The software used has evolved numerous times to keep up with
        the steady advances made in computing technology.  The
        following outlines the progression of the software over
        nearly thirty years:

        <p>
        In 1971, when the Astrogeology's involvement in the Apollo program ended,
        many computer personnel transferred to Eros Data Center, transferred to
        other federal agencies, or took jobs in the private sector.
        Jim Crawforth and Alex Acosta remained and established a computer group to
        serve the Flagstaff Field Center.  Development began of the unnamed image
        processing package on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/20
        with 8K bytes of memory, two 2.5
        megabyte removable disks, an 800BPI tape drive, a card reader, and a
        teletype terminal.  It ran the DOS/Batch, a single user operating
        system, and image display was handled on a $80,000 filmwriter from
        Optronics International Inc.
        </p>

        <p>
        During the following years, the software migrated to a DEC PDP-11/45
        with 256KB of memory and larger 40MB disks the size of washing machines.
        The operating system of choice was RSX-11M, a multi-user system
        accessed through VT52 black and white video terminals.  Programmers
        were restricted to developing applications which utilized a maximum
        of 32KB of memory.  Image display was upgraded from film to a DeAnza
        512x512 Frame Buffer.  This configuration became known as the Flagstaff
        Image Processing System (FIPS)

        <p>
        In the early 1980's, DEC announced their new VAX/VMS computers which
        allowed for virtual addressing.  Developers no longer had restrictions
        on the size of their programs.  With this major change in computing
        environment, the Astrogeology Team selected Eric Eliason to lead
        the conversion of FIPS to the Planetary Image Cartography System
        (PICS).  The Transportable Application Executive (TAE) was chosen
        as the user interface and programs were gradually migrated to VAX/VMS.
        PICS was a popular tool in the planetary community with its ability
        to process Viking, Voyager, Magellan, Landsat and various other
        spacecraft imagery.

        <p>
        In the late 1980's, several major events occurred which significantly
        changed the future of Astrogeology imaging processing software.  The
        first was our involvement in the Galileo NIMS mission.  PICS could
        handle multi-spectral instruments with two to seven bands, but the
        burden was on the user to manage each band as a separate file.  The
        hyper-spectral NIMS instrument would have 200-300 bands making
        management under PICS an impossibility.  At this
        time, a completely new software system was invented.  The
        Integrated System for Imaging Spectrometers (ISIS) came into
        existence under the guidance of designer Jim Torson and developer
        Kris Becker. The prototype software was released as Isis 2.0.

        A second major event occurred in the early 1990's, the Clementine
        mission. Literally hundreds of thousands of images would be
        collected.  Unfortunately, PICS operated on VAX/VMS, an aging
        and expensive computer system.  The planetary community often
        lamented over the $50,000 for a single machine including a
        display device.  At this time, Unix began to make a push
        into the computing world.  Astrogeology made the decision to
        merge the VAX/VMS versions ISIS and PICS under Unix.  The integration
        of PICS into ISIS was lead by Kay Edwards.  The primary Unix platforms
        supported were SunOS and DEC OSF1. This version is referred to as Isis 2.1.
        </p>

        <p>
        During the late 1990's, ISIS continued to grow in
        both number of applications
        and the supported operating systems.  Software to process data from
        Galileo SSI, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor MOC, Mars Odyssey
        Themis, and other instruments was added.  The software was ported
        to the
        Linux operating system as the demand for cheaper computers with
        "Open Software" increased.  TAE was still the user interface but
        display software ran under X-windows making visual image analysis
        available directly on the user's desktop.  ISIS made huge gains in
        usage by non-USGS customers, especially with increased focus on
        cartographic processing.  So much so that the Astrogeolgy Team
        changed the meaning of the acronym to Integrated System for Imagers
        and Spectrometers.

        <p>
        In 2001, Astrogeology recognized the software was approaching an
        end-of-life cycle.  Users constantly asked for TAE to be replaced
        by a standard Graphical User Interface (GUI).  The ISIS development staff
        were unable to use many powerful debugging tools because they
        did not function at all on Fortran and had other issues with combined
        Fortran/C programs.  Many of the Open Source APIs were only available
        in C++ or Java and thus not available for usage. Aging cube file
        formats would not efficiently support missions with line scan cameras.
        These and many other reasons led to the decision to modernize ISIS.
        Led by Jeff Anderson, work began in December 2001 on the conversion
        of Isis to C++.
