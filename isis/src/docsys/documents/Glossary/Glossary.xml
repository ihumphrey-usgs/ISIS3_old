          </definition>

          <definition name="Band">
            A layer of pixels in an image, typically representing spectral
            information.  The number of bands indicates the depth of an image in
            terms of these layers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit">
            Short for binary digit, which in a computer is the smallest unit of
            storage. Bits are either "0" or "1".
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit Type">
            Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an
            image cube file.
          </definition>

          <definition name="SPICE">
            Spacecraft &amp; Planetary ephemerides, Instrument C-matrix and
            Event kernels.  SPICE refers to all the information required by Isis
            in order to compute and map each image pixel onto a surface with
            reference to spacecraft position, sun position, instrument and
            mission activities.  Isis uses software supplied by the Navigation
            and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) for SPICE access and
            kernel management (Refer to spiceinit).

            <p>
              SPICE is available only for mission instruments supported by Isis
              (camera models).
            </p>
          </definition>

          </definition>

          <definition name="Reference Measure">
            Reference Measure is a fundamental component of the control network.
            For every point within the network, there is always one and only one
            associated Reference Measure (Reference=True).  The Reference
            Measure refers to a single image and it's pixel coordinate (measure)
            that best represents a control point location or feature.  This
            specific element of the control network is exclusively used for
            co-registering all other overlapping and potential measures (images)
            to the Reference Measure.  There are control network applications
            that can set the Reference=True explicitly (cnetref, qnet) or
            'runtime' implicitly (If reference is not set, the implicit default
            is the first 'valid' measure listed within a control point, refer to
            the 'pointreg' application for more information). 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Special Pixels">
            Special Pixels are defined to distinguish valid pixels from
            non-valid pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for "binary term". A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            most modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
          </definition>

          <definition name="NULL">
            NULL is a Special Pixel value that is tracked and reported to the
            user.  NULL represents "No Data".   NULL is set in all 8, 16, 32-bit
            type image data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="LRS">
            LRS [Low Representation Saturation] is a representation special
            pixel value that is tracked and reported to the user.  LRS is set
            when an Isis application causes the output DN pixel to fall 'below'
            the possible range of valid values LRS  represents "Undersaturated".
            LRS is set in 16-and 32-bit type image data.  For output 8-bit, LRS
            = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="HRS">
            HRS [High Representation Saturation] is a representation special
            pixel value that is tracked and reported to the user.  HRS is set
            when an Isis application causes the output DN pixel to fall 'above'
            the possible range of valid values HRS represents "Oversaturated".
            HRS is set in all 8, 16, 32-bit type image data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Measure">
            The sample and line pixel coordinate (measurement) within an image
            that has been measured and associated with a Control Point.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Network">
            A network of Control Points.  A file
            containing fields of information for control points and measures
            between a collection of any number of images.

          <definition name="LIS">
            LIS [Low Instrument Saturation] is an instrument special pixel value
            that is tracked and reported to the user.  LIS is set during the
            ingestion of the image data into Isis.  The input image sensor
            acquired a value too low to be measured accurately.  LIS represents
            "Undersaturated".  LIS is set in 16-and 32-bit type image data.  For
            8-bit, LIS = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="HIS">
            HIS [High Instrument Saturation] is an instrument special pixel
            value that is tracked and reported to the user.  HIS is set during
            the ingestion of the image data into Isis.  The input image sensor
            acquired a value too high to be measured accurately.  HIS represents
            "Oversaturated".  HIS is set in 16-and 32-bit type image data.  For
            8-bit image data, HIS = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube">
            A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and
            bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of
            samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).

            <p>
              Typically, the sample and line dimensions are used to represent
              spatial information while the band dimension represents spectral
              information.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line">
            A row of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of lines indicates the height of an image
            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample">
            A column of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial

            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Digital Number">
            The numeric value of a single pixel in an image. The value may
            represent almost any unit. For example: reflectance, radiance,
            elevation, or radius. DNs can be discrete integers or floating
            point values. 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level0">
            Level0 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been ingested into Isis (PDS EDR) and will often have
            SPICE information loaded on the Isis cube labels (spiceinit).
            Level0 image cubes are often the input to mission specific
            radiomatric calibration applications if supported in Isis.  Level1
            implies a 'non-projected', raw image cube.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level1">
            Level1 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been radiometrically calibrated (PDS CDR) with SPICE
            information loaded on the Isis cube labels.  This level will often
            represent an image that also has had  noise removed.  Level1 implies
            a 'non-projected' cube.  Isis reports the camera geometry (viewing
            geometry of an image cube) for a Level1. Most Isis application names
            that start with a prefix of 'cam' expects a Level1 cube as input
            (refer to applications such as camstats, campt, cam2map).
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level2">
            Level2 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been map projected.  The Level2 image cube labels contain
            Mapping keywords that describe the projection and all associated map
            characteristics.  Most Isis applications that start with a prefix of
            'map' expects a Level2 cube as input (refer to applications such as
            mappt, map2map, map2cam).
          </definition>

          <definition name="Serial Number">
            A unique identifier constructed and assigned to each individual
            image within a control network.  The serial number (SN) is
            constructed by most of the control network applications "in real
            time" from specific instrument keywords on the image labels
            (Instrument keywords are populated by mission specific ingestion
            applications).

            <p>
              The serial number associated with each control measure is included
              as a field in the binary control network.  'getsn' is an Isis
              application that will return the SN value for a given image
              filename.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Elevation">
            The height above or below a fixed point on the surface of a body.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Albedo">
            Reflectivity of a surface or particle.  Commonly in I/F units for
            radiometrically calibrated data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Emissivity">
            A measure describing a substance's ability to absorb and radiate
            electromagnetic energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Radiance">
            A measurement describing the amount of electromagnetic energy
            emitted from an area of a planet.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Reflectence">
            The ratio of reflected energy to incoming energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Radius">
            The distance (vector) value between the center of and a point on a
            circle, sphere, ellipse or ellipsoid.  Refer to qview, camstats,
            campt as example reporting applications of the radius value at every
            image pixel location.  Isis expects and reports the radius value to
            be in Meters.

            <p>
              Isis requires a radius DEM model in order to orthorectify an image
              (refer to spicienit- shapemodel and cam2map).  This is not to be
              confused with a topography file where the radius is subtracted
              from the (best fit trixial or aeroid) shape of the target body.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Emission Angle">
            The emission angle (EMA) is the angle between the spacecraft and a
            vector drawn perpendicular to the planet's surface (surface normal).
            Using SPICE, Isis applications compute this angle from the ellipsoid
            or the elevation model (e.g., local slopes) at every pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Incidence Angle">
            The incidence angle (INC) is the angle between the sun and the
            surface normal.  Isis applications use SPICE to compute this angle
            from the ellipsoid or the elevation model (e.g., local slopes) at
            every pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Phase Angle">
            The phase angle is the angle between the sun, the point on the
            planet surface and the spacecraft.  Isis applications will use SPICE
            to compute this angle from the ellipsoid or the elevation model
            (e.g., local slopes) at every pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Pixel Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge
            of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the top edge to the bottom edge
            of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge
            of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Detector Resolution">
            The size of the detector on the focal plane for each pixel. 
          </definition>

          <definition name="I/F">
            Irradiance/SolarFlux.  Unit of DN values for a reference distance of
            target body from the Sun (5.2 AU).  The values usually range between
            0.0 and 1.0.

            <p>
              I/F is often a default or choice of output DN unit of the mission
              specific radiometric calibration applications.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Polygon Thickness">
            The thickness of a polygon is defined as follows:

            <pre>
              Thickness = Area / max(Xextent,Yextent)**2
            </pre>

            A polygon's thickness will be between 0 and 1.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Ground Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle between one reference point and another reference
            point.  Each pixellocation has a latitude, longitude associated with
            it (ground point).  The only information required to calculate a
            ground azimuth is to form a spherical triangle from three points on
            the planet (ground point, north pole, and point of interest) The
            point of interest is often the sub-spacecraft or sub-solar point).
            Spherical trignometry is then used to calculate the angle.

            <p>
              Ground Azimuth has nothing to do with the image, meaning it does
              not rely on camera geometry for its calculation.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to a point of interest.
            The azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a
            reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
            horizontally from the origin point to the right side of the image (3
            o'clock reference if the image is viewed as a clock face) Azimuth
            can also be referred to as Image Azimuth.  
          </definition>

          <definition name="North Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to true North.  The North
            Azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a
            reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
            horizontally from the origin point (pixel location) to the right
            side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sun Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to the direction of the
            Sun.  The Sun Azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction
            from a reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
            horizontally from the origin point (pixel location) to the right
            side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Spacecraft Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to the direction of the
            Spacecraft.  The Spacecraft Azimuth is measured in a positive
            clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference line is
            formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point (pixel
            location) to the right side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Off Nadir Angle">
            From the spacecraft, the Off Nadir is the angle between the nadir
            vector (subspacecraft vector) and the look vector.  Every pixel in
            the image will result in a different Off Nadir Angle.  OffNadirAngle
            is in degrees.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Slew Angle">
            From the spacecraft, the Slew is the angle between the boresight
            (i.e., center of framing camera) and the nadir vector (subspacecraft
            vector).  The Slew angle will be a constant value across the image.
            SlewAngle is in degrees.
          </definition>

          <definition name="SubSpacecraft Ground Azimuth">
            The Ground azimuth to the SubSpacecraft point (where the look vector
            from the spacecraft intercepts the target body) is obtained by
            taking true North (90 deg Latitude) and finding the clockwise angle
            to the subspacecraft latitude and longitude point.  

            <p>
              The subspacecraft ground azimuth is complementary to the emission
              angle and can help to determine if two images would make a good
              stereo pair.  If the camera position (subspacecraft ground
              azimuth) is the same in both images they would not offer stereo.
              If the camera position is slightly off between the two images,
              then they would make a good stereo pair
            </p>

            <p>
              SubSpacecraft Ground Azimuth is in degrees.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Subsolar Ground Azimuth">
            The Ground azimuth to the SubSolar point is obtained by taking true
            North (90 deg Latitude) and finding the clockwise angle to the
            subsolar latitude and longitude point.  

            <p>
              The Subsolar Ground Azimuth is complementary to the incidence
              angle and gives more information about which direction the sun is
              coming from.  
            </p>

            <p>
              SubSolar Ground Azimuth is in degrees.
