        <definitions>
          <definition name="Digital Number">
            Digital Numbers are a subset of Integers, more specifically positive
            integers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Elevation">
            The height above or below a fixed point on the surface of a body.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Emissivity">
            A measure describing a substances ability to absorb and radiate
            electromagnetic energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Radiance">
            A measurement describing the amount of electromagnetic energy
            emitted from an area of a planet.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Reflectence">
            The ratio of reflected energy to incoming energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Measure">
            A coordinate (measurement) on a Cube for a Control Point.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Point">
            One or more measurements that identify the same feature or location
            in different images.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Network">
            A network of Control Points.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube">
            A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and
            bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of
            samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).

            Typically, the sample and line dimensions are used to represent
            spatial information while the band dimension represents spectral
            information. See the table below for examples of the line, sample,
            and band dimensions of a few data sets from planetary missions.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit">
            Short for binary digit, which in a computer is the smallest unit of
            storage. Bits are either "0" or "1".
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            many modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit Type">
            Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an
            image cube file.
          </definition>
