          <definition name="Adjusted">
            The term, Adjusted, refers to the output pixel coordinate or output geographic location
            within a control network.  Applications such as pointreg or jigsaw report and update
            the "Adjusted" output pixel coordinate (pointreg) or geographic location (jigsaw) in
            the output control network.
          </definition>

          <definition name="A Priori">
            The term, "A Priori", refers to the initial or original value of a pixel coordinate or
            geographic location within a control network.  Applications such as pointreg or jigsaw
            refer to the a priori values for an input pixel coordinate (pointreg) or geographic
            location (jigsaw) in an input control network.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Band">
            A 3rd dimensional layer of pixels in an image, typically representing spectral
            information.  The number of bands indicates the depth of an image in
            terms of these layers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit">
            Short for binary digit, which in a computer is the smallest unit of
            storage. Bits are either "0" or "1".
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit Type">
            Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an
            image cube file.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            most modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
            <p>
               Within the ISIS environment, "Byte" refers to how many bits there are
               per single meaningful value in an image cube file.  The Byte information
               for an image cube file is stored on the image cube labels in Group=Pixels, where
               the keywords Type and ByteOrder describe the what byte format the image cube is.

          <definition name="SPICE">
            Spacecraft &amp; Planetary ephemerides, Instrument C-matrix and
            Event kernels.  SPICE refers to all the information required by Isis
            in order to compute and map each image pixel onto a surface with
            reference to spacecraft position, sun position, instrument and
            mission activities.  Isis uses software (ToolKit) supplied by the
            Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) for SPICE access
            and kernel management (Refer to spiceinit).
            <p>
              SPICE is available only for mission instruments supported by Isis
              (camera models).

          </definition>

         <definition name="Control Network">
            A network of Control Points.  Within the ISIS environment, the control network
            file is binary.  The network contains multiple fields of information for
            control points identified and measures collected between any number of image cubes.
            <p>
              Refer to qnet, cneteditor, cnetbin2pvl for more information about the control network
              contents.

          <definition name="Control Point">
            One or more measurements (image coordinates) that identify the same feature or location
            in different overlapping images.
          </definition>

         <definition name="Serial Number">
            A unique identifier constructed and assigned to each individual
            image within a control network.  The serial number (SN) is
            constructed by most of the control network applications "in real
            time" from specific instrument keywords on the image labels
            (Instrument keywords are populated by mission specific ingestion
            applications).
            <p>
              The serial number associated with each control measure is included
              as a field in the binary control network.  'getsn' is an Isis
              application that will return the SN value for a given image
              filename.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Reference Measure">
            Reference Measure is a fundamental component of the control network.
            For every point within the network, there is always one and only one
            associated Reference Measure (Reference=True).  The Reference
            Measure refers to a single image and it's pixel coordinate (measure)
            that best represents a control point location or feature.
            <p>
              This specific element of the control network is exclusively used for
              co-registering all other overlapping and potential measures (images)
              to the Reference Measure.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are control network applications that can set the Reference=True
              explicitly (cnetref, qnet) or 'runtime' implicitly (If reference is not set,
              the implicit default is the first 'valid' measure listed within a control point,
              refer to the 'pointreg' application for more information).
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube">
            A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and
            bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of
            samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).
            <p>
              Typically, the sample and line dimensions are used to represent
              spatial information while the band dimension represents spectral
              information.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line">
            A row of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of lines indicates the total height of an image
            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample">
            A column of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of samples indicates the total width of an image
            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Digital Number">
            The numeric value of a single pixel in an image. The value may
            represent almost any unit. For example: reflectance (I/F), radiance,
            elevation, or radius. Digital Numbers (DNs) can be discrete integers 
            or floating point values.

            Level0 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been ingested into Isis (PDS EDR) and will often have
            SPICE information loaded on the Isis cube labels (spiceinit).
            Level0 image cubes are often the input to mission specific
            radiomatric calibration applications if supported in Isis.
            <p>
              Level0 implies a 'non-projected', raw image cube ('camera space').

            loaded on the Isis cube labels.
            <p>
              This level will often represent an image that also has had  noise removed.
              Isis reports the camera geometry (viewing geometry of an image cube) for
              a Level1. Most Isis application names that start with a prefix of 'cam'
              expect a Level1  cube as input (refer to applications such as camstats, campt, cam2map).
            </p>
            <p>
              Level1 implies a 'non-projected' radiometrically calibrated cube ('camera space').
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level2">
            Level2 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an
            image has been map projected (PDS RDR).  The Level2 image cube labels contain
            Mapping keywords that describe the projection and all associated map
            characteristics.
            <p>
               Most Isis applications that start with a prefix of
              'map' expects a Level2 cube as input (refer to applications such as
               mappt, map2map, map2cam).

          <definition name="Radius">
            The distance (vector) value between the center of and a point on a
            circle, sphere, ellipse or ellipsoid.  Refer to qview, camstats,
            campt as example reporting applications of the radius value at every
            image pixel location.
            <p>
               Isis expects and reports the radius value in Meters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Isis requires a radius DEM model in order to orthorectify an image
              (refer to spiceinit- shapemodel/cam2map).  This is not to be
              confused with a topography file where the radius is subtracted
              from the (best fit trixial or aeroid) shape of the target body.

          </definition>

          <definition name="Emission Angle">
            The emission angle (EMA) is the angle between the spacecraft and a
            vector drawn perpendicular to the planet's surface (surface normal).
            Using SPICE, Isis applications compute this angle from the ellipsoid.
            <p>
              Emission Angle is in degrees.  The valid range is between 0 - 90.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Incidence Angle">
            The incidence angle (INC) is the angle between the sun and the
            surface normal.  Isis applications use SPICE to compute this angle
            from the ellipsoid or the elevation model (e.g., local slopes) at
            every pixel.
            <p>
              Incidence Angle is in degrees.  The valid range is between 0 - 90.
              Data can be illuminated beyond the 90 degrees in the deep terminator
              region.   While this is valid, most photometric functions will
              not normalize beyond 90 degrees.

              Thickness = Area / max(Xextent,Yextent)**2
            </pre>

            A polygon's thickness will be between 0 and 1.

          <definition name="Ground Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle between one reference point and another reference
            point.  Each pixel location has a latitude, longitude associated with
            it (ground point).  The only information required to calculate a
            ground azimuth is to form a spherical triangle from three points on
            the planet (ground point, north pole, and point of interest) The
            point of interest is often the sub-spacecraft or sub-solar point.
            Spherical trignometry is then used to calculate the angle.
            <p>
              Ground Azimuth has nothing to do with the image, meaning it does
              not rely on camera geometry for its calculation.

              The North Azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a
              reference line.  The reference line is formed by a line drawn
              horizontally from the origin point (pixel location) to the right

            Spacecraft.
            <p>
              The Spacecraft Azimuth is measured in a positive
              clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference line is
