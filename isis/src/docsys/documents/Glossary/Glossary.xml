          <definition name="SPICE">
            Spacecraft &amp; Planetary ephemerides, Instrument C-matrix and Event kernels.
            SPICE refers to all the information required by Isis in order to compute
            and map each image pixel onto a surface with reference to spacecraft position, 
            sun position, instrument and mission activities.  Isis uses software supplied
            by the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) for SPICE
            access and kernel management (Refer to spiceinit).

            SPICE is available only for mission instruments supported by Isis (camera models).
          </definition>

          <definition name="Reference Measure">
            Reference Measure is a fundamental component of the control network.
            For every point within the network, there is always one and only one
            associated Reference Measure (Reference=True).  The Reference Measure
            refers to a single image and it's pixel coordinate (measure) that best 
            represents a control point location or feature.  This specific
            element of the control network is exclusively used for co-registering all
            other overlapping and potential measures (images) to the Reference 
            Measure.  There are control network applications that can set the
            Reference=True explicitly (cnetref, qnet) or  'runtime' implicitly 
            (If reference is not set, the implicit default is the first 'valid' 
            measure listed within a control point, refer to the 'pointreg' application
            for more information). 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Special Pixels">
            Special Pixels are defined to distinguish valid pixels from non-valid
            pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            most modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
          </definition>

          <definition name="NULL">
            NULL is a Special Pixel value that is tracked and reported to the user.
            NULL represents "No Data".   NULL is set in all 8, 16, 32-bit type image
            data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="LRS">
            LRS [Low Representation Saturation] is a representation special pixel value
            that is tracked and reported to the user.  LRS is set when an Isis application
            causes the output DN pixel to fall 'below' the possible range of valid values
            LRS  represents "Undersaturated".  LRS is set in 16-and 32-bit type image data.  
            For output 8-bit, LRS = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="HRS">
            HRS [High Representation Saturation] is a representation special pixel value
            that is tracked and reported to the user.  HRS is set when an Isis application
            causes the output DN pixel to fall 'above' the possible range of valid values
            HRS represents "Oversaturated".   HRS is set in all 8, 16, 32-bit type image
            data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Network">
            A network of Control Points.  A file
            containing fields of information for control points and measures
            between a collection of any number of images.
          </definition>

          <definition name="LIS">
            LIS [Low Instrument Saturation] is an instrument special pixel value
            that is tracked and reported to the user.  LIS is set during the ingestion
            of the image data into Isis.  The input image sensor acquired a value too low
            to be measured accurately.  LIS represents "Undersaturated".  LIS is
            set in 16-and 32-bit type image data.  For 8-bit, LIS = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="HIS">
            HIS [High Instrument Saturation] is an instrument special pixel value
            that is tracked and reported to the user.  HIS is set during the ingestion
            of the image data into Isis.  The input image sensor acquired a value too high
            to be measured accurately.  HIS represents "Oversaturated".  HIS is set in 
            16-and 32-bit type image data.  For 8-bit image data, HIS = NULL.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level0">
            Level0 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an image
            has been ingested into Isis (PDS EDR) and will often have SPICE information 
            loaded on the Isis cube labels (spiceinit).  Level0 image cubes are often
            the input to mission specific radiomatric calibration applications if supported
            in Isis.  Level1 implies a 'non-projected', raw image cube.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level1">
            Level1 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an image
            has been radiometrically calibrated (PDS CDR) with SPICE information loaded
            on the Isis cube labels.  This level will often represent an image that also
            has had  noise removed.  Level1 implies a 'non-projected' cube.  Isis 
            reports the camera geometry (viewing geometry of an image cube) for a 
            Level1. Most Isis application names that start with a prefix of 'cam' expects
            a Level1 cube as input (refer to applications such as camstats, campt, cam2map) 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube Serial Number">
            A unique identifier associated with a specific image and its
            derivative images.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Level2">
            Level2 is a standard cartographic processing phase that describes an image
            has been map projected.  The Level2 image cube labels contain Mapping keywords
            that describe the projection and all associated map characteristics.  Most Isis 
            applications that start with a prefix of 'map' expects a Level2 cube as input 
            (refer to applications such as mappt, map2map, map2cam) 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Digital Number">
            The numeric value of a single pixel in an image. The value may
            represent almost any unit. For example: reflectance, radiance,
            elevation, or radius. DNs can be discrete integers or floating
            point values. 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Albedo">
            Reflectivity of a surface or particle.  Commonly in I/F units for radiometrically
            calibrated data.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Radius">
            The distance (vector) value between the center of and a point on a circle, sphere,
            ellipse or ellipsoid.  Refer to qview, camstats, campt as example reporting 
            applications of the radius value at every image pixel location.  Isis expects and
            reports the radius value to be in Meters.

            Isis requires a radius DEM model in order to orthorectify an image (refer to spicienit-
            shapemodel and cam2map).  This is not to be confused with a topography file where the
            radius is subtracted from the (best fit trixial or aeroid) shape of the target body.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Pixel Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the top edge to the bottom edge of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample Resolution">
            The ground distance in meters from the left edge to the right edge of a pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Detector Resolution">
            The size of the detector on the focal plane for each pixel. 
          </definition>

          <definition name="Ground Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle between one reference point and another reference point. 
            Each pixellocation has a latitude, longitude associated with it (ground point).  
            The only information required to calculate a ground azimuth is to form a 
            spherical triangle from three points on the planet (ground point, north pole, 
            and point of interest) The point of interest is often the sub-spacecraft or
            sub-solar point). Spherical trignometry is then used to calculate the angle.

            Ground Azimuth has nothing to do with the image, meaning it does not rely
            on camera geometry for it's calculation
          </definition>

          <definition name="Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to a point of interest.  The azimuth is 
            measured in a positive clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference
            line is formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point to the right
            side of the image (3 o'clock reference if the image is viewed as a clock face)
            Azimuth can also be referred to as Image Azimuth.  
          </definition>

          <definition name="North Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to true North.  The North Azimuth 
            is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference
            line is formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point (pixel location)
            to the right side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sun Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to the direction of the Sun.  The Sun Azimuth 
            is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a reference line.  The reference
            line is formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point (pixel location)
            to the right side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Spacecraft Azimuth">
            A clockwise angle from a point of origin to the direction of the Spacecraft.  
            The Spacecraft Azimuth is measured in a positive clockwise direction from a reference line.  
            The reference line is formed by a line drawn horizontally from the origin point 
            (pixel location) to the right side of the image.  Refer to Azimuth.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Off Nadir Angle">
            From the spacecraft, the Off Nadir is the angle between the nadir vector 
            (subspacecraft vector) and the look vector.  Every pixel in the image will
            result in a different Off Nadir Angle.  OffNadirAngle is in degrees.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Slew Angle">
            From the spacecraft, the Slew is the angle between the boresight
            (i.e., center of framing camera) and the nadir vector (subspacecraft vector).
            The Slew angle will be a constant value across the image.
            SlewAngle is in degrees.
          </definition>

          <definition name="SubSpacecraft Ground Azimuth">
            The Ground azimuth to the SubSpacecraft point (where the look vector from the
            spacecraft intercepts the target body) is obtained by taking true North
            (90 deg Latitude) and finding the clockwise angle to the subspacecraft 
            latitude and longitude point.  

            The subspacecraft ground azimuth is complementary to the emission angle and can 
            help to determine if two images would make a good stereo pair.  If the camera 
            position (subspacecraft ground azimuth) is the same in both images they would 
            not offer stereo.  If the camera position is slightly off between the two images, 
            then they would make a good stereo pair

            SubSpacecraft Ground Azimuth is in degrees.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Subsolar Ground Azimuth">
            The Ground azimuth to the SubSolar point is obtained by taking true North
            (90 deg Latitude) and finding the clockwise angle to the subsolar 
            latitude and longitude point.  

            The Subsolar Ground Azimuth is complementary to the incidence angle and gives
            more information about which direction the sun is coming from.  

            SubSolar Ground Azimuth is in degrees.
