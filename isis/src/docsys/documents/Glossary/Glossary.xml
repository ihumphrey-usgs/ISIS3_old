        <definitions>
          <definition name="Adjusted">
            Refers to the output pixel coordinate or geographic location 
            within the control network
          </definition>

          <definition name="APriori">
            Refers to the initial or original value of a pixel coordinate or
            geographic location within the control network
          </definition>

          <definition name="Band">
            A layer of pixels in an image, typically representing spectral
            information.  The number of bands indicates the depth of an image in
            terms of these layers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit">
            Short for binary digit, which in a computer is the smallest unit of
            storage. Bits are either "0" or "1".
          </definition>

          <definition name="Byte">
            Short for binary term. A byte is a collection of computer bits. On
            many modern computers, a byte is a group of eight bits. Typically,
            computers handle and store information in binary (base-2), and a
            group of eight bits represents an eight digit binary number.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Bit Type">
            Refers to how many bits there are per single meaningful value in an
            image cube file.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Measure">
            The sample and line pixel coordinate (measurement) within an image that
            has been measured and associated with a Control Point.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Network">
            A network of Control Points.  By default this is a binary file
            containing fields of information for control points and measures
            between a collection of any number of images.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Control Point">
            One or more measurements that identify the same feature or location
            in different images.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube">
            A cube is a 3-dimensional image with axis: samples, lines, and
            bands. The physical dimensions of a cube are called the number of
            samples (NS), number of lines (NL), and number of bands (NB).

            <p>
              Typically, the sample and line dimensions are used to represent
              spatial information while the band dimension represents spectral
              information. See the table below for examples of the line, sample,
              and band dimensions of a few data sets from planetary missions.
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Cube Serial Number">
            A unique identifier assigned to a specific observation.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Digital Number">
            Digital Numbers are a subset of Integers, more specifically positive
            integers.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Elevation">
            The height above or below a fixed point on the surface of a body.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Emissivity">
            A measure describing a substance's ability to absorb and radiate
            electromagnetic energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Emission Angle">
            The emission angle (EMA) is the angle between the spacecraft and a
            vector drawn perpendicular to the planet's surface (surface normal).
            Using SPICE, Isis applications compute this angle from the ellipsoid 
            or the elevation model (e.g., local slopes) at every pixel.  
          </definition>

         <definition name="Incidence Angle">
            The incidence angle (INC) is the angle between the sun and the 
            surface normal.  Isis applications use SPICE to compute this angle
            from the ellipsoid or the elevation model (e.g., local slopes) at
            every pixel.
          </definition>

         <definition name="I/F">
            Irradiance/SolarFlux.  Unit of DN values for a reference distance of
            target body from the Sun (5.2 AU).  The values usually range between
            0.0 and 1.0.

            <p>
              I/F is often a default or choice of output DN unit of the mission
              specific radiometric calibration applications. 
            </p>
          </definition>

          <definition name="Line">
            A row of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of lines indicates the height of an image
            in pixels.
          </definition>

         <definition name="NAIF">
            Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility
          </definition>

          <definition name="Phase Angle">
            The phase angle is the angle between the sun, the point on the
            planet surface and the spacecraft.  Isis applications will use SPICE
            to compute this angle from the ellipsoid or the elevation model
            (e.g., local slopes) at every pixel.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Polygon Thickness">
            The thickness of a polygon is defined as follows:
            <pre>
              Thickness = Area / max(Xextent,Yextent)**2
            </pre>
            A polygon's thickness will be between 0 and 1.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Radiance">
            A measurement describing the amount of electromagnetic energy
            emitted from an area of a planet.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Reflectence">
            The ratio of reflected energy to incoming energy.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Sample">
            A column of pixels in an image, typically representing spatial
            information.  The number of samples indicates the width of an image
            in pixels.
          </definition>

          <definition name="Serial Number">
            A unique identifier constructed and assigned to each individual
            image within a control network.  The serial number (SN) is
            constructed by most of the control network applications "in real
            time" from specific instrument keywords on the image labels
            (Instrument keywords are populated by mission specific ingestion
            applications).  

            <p>
              The serial number associated with each control measure is included
              as a field in the binary control network.  'getsn' is an Isis
              application that will return the SN value for a given image
              filename.
            </p>
          </definition>

         <definition name="SPICE">
           Spacecraft &amp; Planetary ephemerides, Instrument C-matrix and Event
           kernels.  SPICE refers to all the information required and computed
           within Isis to map each image onto a surface with reference to
           spacecraft position, sun position, instrument and mission activities.
           Isis uses software supplied by the Navigation and Ancillary
           Information Facility (NAIF) for SPICE access and kernel management.
