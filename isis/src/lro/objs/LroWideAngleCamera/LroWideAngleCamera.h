   * @brief LRO Wide Angle Camera Model

   * @internal
   *   @history 2009-07-15 Steven Lambright - Added support for COLOROFFSET
   *   @history 2009-08-28 Steven Lambright - Changed inheritance to no longer
   *            inherit directly from Camera
   *   @history 2009-09-09 Steven Lambright - Updated wavelengths
   *   @history 2009-11-06 Steven Lambright - FilterName keyword is now Center
   *   @history 2010-03-15 Steven Lambright - Tiling hint now set to a safe
   *            value regardless of output projection resolution. Also
   *            incorporated ASU's changes for new modes.
   *   @history 2010-05-12 Kris Becker - Added checks for number of bands to
   *            match number of values in BandBin/Center keyword and insure a
   *            valid band is selected in SetBand() method;  Rewrote the
   *            camera distortion model that also requires negative
   *            coefficients in IK kernel.
   *   @history 2010-08-21 Kris Becker - Reworked the camera model to
   *          utilize the contents of the IK, which is new. The LRO/LROC IK
   *          lro_lroc_v14.ti and higher contain the appropriate parameters to
   *          coincide with the code changes made here. IMPORTANT:  This
   *          results in Version = 2 of the LroWideAngleCamera as depicted in
   *          the Camera.plugin for both WAC-UV and WAC-VIS.
   *   @history 2010-10-04 Kris Becker - Modified the frame kernel code to use
   *            the instrument code instead of the WAC ID.  This change was
   *            brought about with the release of frames kernel
   *            lro_frames_2010214_v01.tf (actually used version 2010277 that
   *            contains updated angles for VIS and UV).
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Updated unitTest to test for new
   *            methods. Updated documentation. Removed Lro namespace wrap
   *            inside Isis namespace wrap. Added Isis Disclaimer to files.
   *            Added NAIF error check to constructor.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook, Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis 
   *            coding standards. References #972.
