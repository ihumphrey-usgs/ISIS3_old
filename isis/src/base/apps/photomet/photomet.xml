    Perform photometric corrections on a cube
  </brief>

  <description>
    This program performs photometric corrections on a cube. It can be used
    to normalize an image for mosaicking. The user must input the cube with a
    pvl containing the corresponding photometric parameters.  Examples of sample
    pvl files are shown below. There are three aspects of photometric correction 
    that need to be considered when running the photomet program:
  
    <pre>
    1) Surface photometric function model type
    2) Atmospheric photometric function model type
    3) Type of normalization to be performed
    </pre>
  
    The types of surface photometric function model types currently available
    in photomet are:
    <pre>
    HapkeHen        : Hapke-Henyey-Greenstein photometric model. Derive model 
                      albedo using complete Hapke model with Henyey-Greenstein 
		      single-particle phase function whose coefficients are 
		      Hg1 and Hg2, plus single scattering albedo Wh, opposition
		      surge parameters Hh and B0, and macroscopic roughness
		      Theta.
    Lambert         : Simple photometric model which predicts that light
                      incident on a surface is scattered uniformly in all
		      directions; the total amount of reflected light depends
		      on the incidence angle of the illumination. This function
		      does not depend upon the outgoing light direction.
    LommelSeeliger  : This model takes into account the radiance that results
                      from single scattering (scattering of collimated
		      incident light) and does not take into account the
		      radiance that results from multiple scattering (scattering
		      of diffuse light which has made its way indirectly to
		      the same position by being scattered one or more times).
		      This model depends on the incidence and emission angles.
    LunarLambert    : This model combines a weighted sum of the LommelSeeliger
                      and Lambert models. Given a suitable value for the
		      LunarLambert function weight, L, this model fits the true
		      reflectance behavior of many planetary surfaces equally
		      well as the Hapke model. This model also depends on the
		      incidence and emission angles.
    Minnaert        : This model expands upon the Lambert function by introducing
                      constant, K, that is used to describe the roughness of a
		      surface. When the K constant is set to 1.0, then the 
		      Minnaert model is equivalent to the Lambert model.
    LunarLambertMcEwen : This model was developed specifically for use with the
                      Moon. This model was designed to be used in conjunction
		      with the MoonAlbedo normalization model.
    </pre>
  
    The types of atmospheric photometric function model types currently
    available in photomet are:
  
    <pre>
    Anisotropic1    : Uses Chandrasekhar's solution for anisotropic scattering
                      described by a one term Legendre polynomial. This model
		      uses first order scattering approximation.
    Anisotropic2    : Uses Chandrasekhar's solution for anisotropic scattering
                      described by a one term Legendre polynomial. This model
		      uses second order scattering approximation. It is slower
		      but more accurate than Anisotropic1.
    HapkeAtm1       : Provides an approximation for strongly anisotropic
                      scattering that is similar to Hapke's model for a planetary
		      surface. The Chandrasekhar solution for isotropic
		      scattering is used for the multiple scattering terms, and
		      a correction is made to the singly scattered light for
		      anisotropic particle phase function. A one term Henyey
		      Greenstein function is used. This model uses a first
		      order scattering approximation.
    HapkeAtm2       : Provides an approximation for strongly anisotropic
                      scattering that is similar to Hapke's model for a planetary
		      surface. The Chandrasekhar solution for isotropic
		      scattering is used for the multiple scattering terms, and
		      a correction is made to the singly scattered light for
		      anisotropic particle phase function. A one term Henyey
		      Greenstein function is used. This model uses a second
		      order scattering approximation. It is slower but more
		      accurate than HapkeAtm1.
    Isotropic1      : Uses Chandrasekhar's solution for isotropic scattering.
                      This model uses first order scattering approximation.
    Isotropic2      : Uses Chandrasekhar's solution for isotropic scattering.
                      This model uses second order scattering approximation.
		      It is slower but more accurate than Isotropic1.

    The types of normalization models currently available in photomet are:
  
    <pre>
    Albedo          : Normalization without atmosphere. Each pixel is divided by 
                      the model photometric function evaluated at the geometry
                      of that pixel, then multiplied by the function at reference
		      geometry with incidence and phase angles equal to Incref
		      and emission angle 0. This has the effect of removing
		      brightness variations due to incidence angle and showing
		      relative albedo variations with the same contrast
		      everywhere. If topographic shading is present, it will be
		      amplified more in regions of low incidence angle and will
		      not appear uniform.
    AlbedoAtm       : Normalization with atmosphere. For each pixel, a model of 
                      atmospheric scattering is subtracted and a surface model
                      is divided out, both evaluated at the actual geometry of
		      the pixel. Then the resulting value is multiplied by the 
		      surface function at reference conditions is added. In 
		      normal usage, the reference condition has normal incidence
		      (Incref=0) and no atmosphere (Tauref=0) but in some cases
		      it may be desirable to normalize images to a different
		      incidence angle or a finite optical depth to obtain a more
		      uniform appearance. As with the Albedo model, if 
		      topographic shading is present, it will be amplified more at
		      high incidence angles and will not appear uniform.
    Mixed           : Normalization without atmosphere. Used to do albedo 
                      normalization over most of the planet, but near the 
                      terminator it will normalize topographic contrast to avoid
		      the seams that can occur with the usual albedo normalization.
		      The two effects will be joined seamlessly at incidence 
		      angle Incmat. Incmat must be adjusted to give the best
		      equalization of contrast at all incidence angles. The
		      Albedo parameter must also be adjusted so the topographically
		      normalized regions at high incidence angle are set to an
		      albedo compatible with the albedo-normalized data at lower
		      incidence.
    MoonAlbedo      : Normalization without atmosphere. This model was designed
                      specifically for use on Lunar data. It will compute 
                      normalized albedo for the Moon, normalized to 0 degrees
		      emission angle and 30 degrees illumination and phase angles.
		      The LunarLambertMcEwen photometric function was designed to 
                      be used with this normalization model.
    NoNormalization : Normalization without atmosphere. No normalization is 
                      performed. Only photometric correction is performed.
    Shade           : Normalization without atmosphere. The surface photometric 
                      function is evaluated at the geometry of the image in order
                      to calculate a shaded relief image of the ellipsoid (and
		      in the future the DEM). The radiance of the model surface
		      is set to Albedo at incidence angle Incref and zero phase.
		      The image data is not used.
    ShadeAtm        : Normalization with atmosphere. The surface photometric 
                      function is used to simulate an image by relief shading,
                      just like the Shade model, but the effects of atmospheric
		      scattering are also included in the calculation.
    Topo            : Normalization without atmosphere. Used to normalize 
                      topographic shading to uniform contrast regardless of 
                      incidence angle. Such a normalization would exagerate
		      albedo variations at large incidence angles, so this model
		      is used as part of a three step process in which (1) the
		      image is temporarily normalized for albedo; (2) a highpass
		      divide filter is used to remove regional albedo variations;
		      and (3) the image is renormalized with the Topo mode to 
		      undo the first normalization and equalize topographic 
		      shading. The reference state in the first step MUST have
		      Incref=0 because this is waht is undone in the final step.
		      If there are no significant albedo variations, step (2)
		      can be skipped but step (1) must not be.
    TopoAtm         : Normalization with atmosphere. As with the Topo model, 
                      this option is used in the final step of a three step
		      process: (1) normalize with the AlbedoAtm model, Incref=0,
		      and Tauref=0 to temporarily remove atmosphere and normalize
		      albedo variations; (2) use highpass divide filter to remove
		      albedo variations; and (3) normalize with the TopoAtm model
		      to undo the temporary normalization and equalize topographic
		      shading.
    </pre>
  
    As you can see above, the only normalization models that make use of atmospheric
    correction are: AlbedoAtm, ShadeAtm, and TopoAtm. Atmospheric correction is not
    applied by any of the other normalization models. If you specify an atmospheric
    model in a PVL along with a normalization model that does not do atmospheric
    correction, then the atmospheric model will be ignored.
  
    Each of the above photometric, atmospheric, and normalization models has specific
    parameters that apply to them. Here is a list of the models and their related
