    This program prepares DEMs for use as shape models. It is not valid to run this program on anything but a DEM.

  <description>
    This program performs the necessary preparation of a DEM file so that it can be used as a shape model. The
    method used to find the intersection of a look vector with a DEM surface has recently changed (9/2010) to
    take care of problems that were encountered at the poles of the DEM file that were caused by artifacts
    generated near the poles when the DEM was produced. This new intersection algorithm requires that the DEM
    have a padded line at any pole that exists in the DEM file. If the DEM is a global DEM, then the left and
    right edges are also padded with a single column of pixels. The padding allows the bilinear interpolation
    to work properly at the poles. The new algorithm also requires that the DEM have a table blob in its labels
    ("ShapeModelStatistics") which contains the minimum and maximum radii that occcur in the DEM file. This
    information is required in order to bracket the solution where the look vector intersects the DEM. This 
    information helps to make the algorithm run much faster. The DEM is required to be a Planetocentric file
    in Simple Cylindrical projection. If it is not, then the demprep program will fail. This program will first
    check to see if the DEM has been padded. If padding has already occurred, then no further padding will be
    added. It is not valid to run this program on anything but a DEM.
