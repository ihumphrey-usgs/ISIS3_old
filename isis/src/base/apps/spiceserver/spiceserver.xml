    Spiceinit Server
  </brief>

  <description>
    This is the server-side program to handle spiceinit web requests. The input
    is the spiceinit program's hex-encoded message (POSTED to a web server). The
    output file is what needs to be sent back to the client. This program is
    generally run by a web server and not by hand. The script:
      "isis/src/base/apps/spiceserver/assets/spiceinit.cgi"
    is an example of a perl script wrapper for running a spice server and using
    this program.

          Verify the input hex-encoded file reports the same Isis version as the current version
          of Isis (requester's version matches server's version).

        <description>
          The input file (which comes from spiceinit's SpiceClient) contains the version of Isis
          that the requester is running. No guarantees can be made for the validity/usability of
          the results of the Isis versions of the client and server don't match. This option
          causes spiceserver to throw an error if the versions of Isis do not match.
