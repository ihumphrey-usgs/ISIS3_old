  <brief>
    Creates cubes that have slope data or aspect data
  </brief>

  <description>
    This program will compute the slope or aspect of a cube.  Typically a digital terrain model with DN
    values representing the radius of a target body is
    given as the input but other non-radius datasets can be provided. Horne's algorithm is used
    to compute the slope or aspect. A 3x3 kernel:<pre>
   A  B  C
   D  E  F
   G  H  I</pre>
   is convolved through the image and each output pixel is computed as follows:
<pre>
  <b>SLOPE EQUATION</b>
   [dz/dx] = ((C + 2F + I) - (A + 2D + G)) / (8 * X_PIXEL_RESOLUTION) 
   [dz/dy] = ((G + 2H + I) - (A + 2B + C)) / (8 * Y_PIXEL_RESOLUTION)

   slope = ATAN ( SQRT ( [dz/dx]^2 + [dz/dy]^2 ) )
   percentslope = slope / 90

  <b>ASPECT EQUATION</b>
   [dz/dx] = ((C + 2F + I) - (A + 2D + G)) / 8
   [dz/dy] = ((G + 2H + I) - (A + 2B + C)) / 8

   aspect = 90 - ATAN2 ([dz/dy], -[dz/dx])
   if (aspect &lt; 0) then aspect = aspect + 360
</pre>
  Slope is typically betwen 0 and 90 degrees, flat to vertical slope,
  respectively. The aspect represents the direction (0 to 360) of the slope in pixel space.  
  From the center pixel (E), 0 degrees is straight towards B, 45 is towards C, 90 is towards F,
  135 is towards I, 180 is towards H, and so on.  The may choose to output the slope in
  radians, degrees, or percent slope, the aspect in degrees or radians.

  <p>
    The slope equation above assumes the pixels are not square: hence X_PIXEL_RESOLUTION and
    Y_PIXEL_RESOLUTION.  That is, the x distance across the pixel is not equal to the y distance 
    from top to the bottom of the pixel.   By default the program will attempt to remove any
    scaling differences by using the map projection information (PIXRES=AUTOMATIC).  This
    computation is done at every pixel so the correct x-to-y ratio is computed.  This
    is important for global maps where the x/y ratio deviates with distance from the latitude
    and/or longitude of true scale in the map projection. If the image lacks a map projection
    then the user must provide the pixel resolution via PIXRES=USER. For this option the pixels are
    assumed to be square.
    The user then provides a single value (RESOLUTION) that will be applied to all pixels in the
    image and in both directions.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The second assumption is the xy units are the same as the z (pixel) units. By default
    the program assumes the units are the same, but allows the user to scale the z units to the xy
    units using the CONVERSIONFACTOR parameter if the PIXRES=USER option is being used.

      Changed the slope algorithm to compute the sample and line resolution
      at each pixel.  Previously the algorithm used the resolution at the
      center of the image. In projected images the resolution varies as you
      move away from the latitude and/or longitude of true scale.   Also, improved the
      documentation and added user options to output percent slope.

      Backward Compatibility Issue: Changed the default output to be slope rather than percent
      slope.
      Backward Compatibility Issue: Removed ability to supply a conversion factor when using
      the automatic resolution option (CONVERSION=AUTOMATIC). AUTOMATIC, assumes the DNs in 
      the cube have units of meters.
      Added a test to the CONVERSION=AUTOMATIC option so DNs in the cube with negative values
      will cause a better error to be shown. Added a BANDBIN group to the output cube labels.

              for the entire image in both the X and Y directions. Note:  If the pixel height
              varies significantly from the width, the slope will not be computed correctly.

        <description>
          Since the slope algorithm depends on cancelling out the units, the
          conversion factor from the z vertical (input pixel) units to the xy horizontal (spatial)
          units needs to be considered.

          For example, if the
          xy units are in meters and the z units are in kilometers the unit conversion factor
          should be 1000 as we are converting z kilometers to xy meters.  

          The default presumes the units are the same.
