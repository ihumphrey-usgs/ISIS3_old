   * @brief Mosaic two cubs together
   *
   * This class allows a programmer to develop a program which merges two cubes
   * together. The application sets the position where input (child) cube will be
   * placed in the mosaic (parent) cube and priority. The the Mosaic object will
   * merge the overlapping area.
