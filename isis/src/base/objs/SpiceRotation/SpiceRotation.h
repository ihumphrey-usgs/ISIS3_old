  /**
   * @brief Obtain SPICE rotation information for a body
   *
   * This class will obtain the rotation from J2000 to a particular reference
   * frame, for example the rotation from J2000 to MOC NA.
   *
   * It is essentially used to convert position vectors from one frame to
   * another, making it is a C++ wrapper to the NAIF routines pxform_c and
   * mxv or mtxv.  Therefore, appropriate NAIF kernels are expected to be
   * loaded prior to using this class.  A position can be returned in either
   * the J2000 frame or the selected reference frame.  See NAIF required
   * reading for more information regarding this subject at
   * ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/ascii/individual_docs/spk.req
   * <p>
   * An important functionality of this class is the ability to cache the
   * rotations so they do not have to be constantly read from the NAIF kernels
   * and they can be more conveniently updated.  Once the data is cached, the
   * NAIF kernels can be unloaded.  If the rotation has a fixed part and a time-
   * based part, the rotation is computed and stored in those two parts.

   *   @history 2005-12-01 Debbie A. Cook Original Version modified from
   *                           SpicePosition class by Jeff Anderson
   *   @history 2006-03-23 Jeff Anderson modified SetEphemerisTime to return
   *                           if the time did not change to improve speed.
   *   @history 2006-10-18 Debbie A. Cook Added method, WrapAngle, to wrap
   *                           angles around 2 pi
   *   @history 2007-12-05 Debbie A. Cook added method SetPolynomialDegree to
   *                           allow the degree of the polynomials fit to the
   *                           camera angles to be changed.  Also changed the
   *                           polynomial from a fixed 2nd order polynomial to
   *                           an nth degree polynomial with one independent
   *                           variable.  PartialType was revised and the calls
   *                           to SetReferencePartial (has an added argument,
   *                           coefficient index) and DPolynomial (argument type
   *                           changed to int) were revised. The function was
   *                           changed from Parabola to Polynomial1Variable, now
   *                           called PolynomialUnivariate. New methods
   *                           GetBaseTime and SetOverrideBaseTime were added
   *   @history 2008-02-15 Debbie A. Cook added a new error message to handle
   *                           the case where the Naif reference frame code is
   *                           not recognized.
   *   @history 2008-06-18 Unknown - Fixed documentation, added NaifStatus calls
   *   @history 2008-11-26 Debbie A. Cook Added method to set axes of rotation.
   *                           Default axes are still 3,1,3 so existing software
   *                           will not be affected by the change.  Also added
   *                           timeScale to the the class and made some
   *                           parameters protected instead of private so they
   *                           are available to inheriting classes.
   *   @history 2008-12-12 Debbie A. Cook Added method to return frame code
   *   @history 2009-01-26 Debbie A. Cook Added wrap of 3rd camera angle when
   *                           crossing +-180
   *   @history 2009-04-21 Debbie A. Cook Added methods MinimizeCache and
   *                           LoadTimeCache, variable p_minimizeCache, and
   *                           enum constants DownsizeStatus
   *   @history 2009-06-29 Debbie A. Cook Fixed memory overwrite problem in
   *                           LoadTimeCache when reading a type 3 ck
   *   @history 2009-07-24 Debbie A. Cook Removed downsizing for Nadir
   *                           instrument pointing tables (LoadTimeCache) so
   *                           that radar instruments will work.  Current
   *                           downsizing code requires sclk and radar has no
   *                           sclk.
   *   @history 2009-10-01 Debbie A. Cook Divided the rotation into a constant
   *                           (in time) part and a time-based part and
   *                           added keywords listing the frame chains for both
   *                           the constant part and the time-based part.
   *   @history 2009-10-09 Debbie A. Cook Added angular velocity when it is
   *                           available
   *   @history 2009-10-30 Unknown - Modified J2000Vector and ReferenceVector
   *                           to work on either length 3 vectors (position
   *                           only) or lenght 6 vectors (position and velocity)
   *                           and added private method StateTJ()
   *   @history 2009-12-03 Debbie A. Cook Modified tests in LoadTimeCache to
   *                           allow observation to cross segment boundary for
   *                           LRO
   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook Revised ReloadCache including removing
   *                           obsolete arguments.  Added initialization of
   *                           members p_fullCacheStartTime, p_fullCacheEndTime,
   *                           and p_fullCacheSize.  Added these same values to
   *                           the table label in method Cache and the reading
   *                           of these values to the method LoadCache(table).
   *                           Improved error message in FrameTrace.  Also
   *                           corrected a comment in StateTJ
   *   @history 2010-09-23 Debbie A. Cook Revised to write out line cache for
   *                           updated pointing when cache size is 1. If the
   *                           original pointing had an angular velocity in
   *                           this case, the original angular velocity is
   *                           written out along with the updated quaternion.
   *                           Also added method Extrapolate, to extrapolate
   *                           pointing assuming a constant angular velocity.
   *                           This method was designed to compute the pointing
   *                           at the start and end of the exposure for framing
   *                           cameras to create a ck that would cover a single
   *                           framing observation.
   *   @history 2010-12-22 Debbie A. Cook  Added new method
   *                           SetFullCacheParameters to upgrade appjit to
   *                           current instrument Rotation group labels.
   *   @history 2011-02-17 Debbie A. Cook  Fixed bug in method LineCache and
   *                           fixed computation of angular velocity in method
   *                           DCJdt (derivative was with respect to scaled et
   *                           instead of et)
   *   @history 2011-02-22 Debbie A. Cook - Corrected Extrapolation method
   *   @history 2011-03-25 Debbie A. Cook - Added method GetCenterAngles()
   *   @history 2011-07-20 Kris J Becker - Modified
   *                           SpiceRotation::LoadCache(Table &table) to be
   *                           reentrant.  This mod was necessitated by the Dawn
   *                           VIR instrument.
   *   @history 2012-05-28 Debbie A. Cook - Programmer notes - A new
   *                           interpolation algorithm, PolyFunctionOverSpice,
   *                           was added and new supporting methods:
   *                           SetEphemerisTimePolyOverSpice,  SetEphemerisTimeSpice,
   *                           SetEphemerisTimeNadir, SetEphemerisTimeMemcache,
   *                           and SetEphemerisTimePolyFunction.
   *                           PolyFunctionOverSpice is never output, but is
   *                           converted to a line cache and reduced.  Methods
   *                           LineCache and ReloadCache were modified to do the
   *                           reduction and a copy constructor was added to
   *                           support the reduction.  Also an argument was
   *                           added to SetPolynomial methods for function type,
   *                           since PolyFunction is no longer the only function
   *                           supported.  These changes help the BundleAdjust
   *                           applications to better fit line scan images where
   *                           the pointing was not modeled well with a regular
   *                           polynomial.
   *   @history 2012-10-25 Jeannie Backer - Brought class closer to Isis3
   *                           standards: Ordered includes in cpp file, replaced
   *                           quotation marks with angle braces in 3rd party
   *                           includes, fixed history indentation and line
   *                           length. References #1181.
   *   @history 2013-03-27 Jeannie Backer - Added methods for MsiCamera. Brought
   *                           class closer to Isis3 standards: moved method
   *                           implementation to cpp file, fixed documentation.
   *                           References #1248.
   *
   *  @todo Downsize using Hermite cubic spline and allow Nadir tables to be downsized again.
