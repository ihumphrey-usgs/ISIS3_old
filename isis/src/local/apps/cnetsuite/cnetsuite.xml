      The main window state is now saved properly when running cnetsuite. If running cnetsuite
      without opening a project, the config files are saved as cnetsuite_Project.config (Project is
      the default project name). Otherwise, when a project is loaded, config files are saved as
      cnetsuite_ProjectName.config, where ProjectName is the name of the loaded project.
      Fixes #4358.

      Changed the alias reference for the data_management.png icon from 'data' to 'data-management'.  
      Annoying errors were showing up on the command line when the application was launched due
      to a naming conflict.  Fixes #3982.
