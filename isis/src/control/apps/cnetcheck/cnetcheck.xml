    Checks for validity of a Control Net file.
  </brief>

  <description>
    Checks for the validity of a Control Net file given a cube list.  Its primary
    function is to check and find islands of the Control Net.  These islands
    are then written to seperate files, which lists the cubes and their
    corresponding serial number.  If a serial number's cube is not listed in
    the input list, than that cube will NOT be listed within the appropriate
    island file.  If an island file is missing altogether, it is due to the fact
    that all of that islands cubes were not listed in the input list.

    cnetcheck should be ran from the directory you wish for the output files to 
    be written to.

        <brief>
          Check for images whose convex hull coverages are below given TOLERANCE
        </brief>
        <description>
          <p>
            A convex hull is constructed from all Control Measures falling on
            the image in "image space".  The purpose of the convex hull is to
            give a rough estimation of how much a given image is "covered" by
            the Control Points in a Control Network.  By enabling this option, a
            file named [PREFIX]ConvexHull.txt will be created containing all
            images (with corresponding serial numbers) whose convex hull
            coverage is less than the given user-specified TOLERANCE.
          </p>
          <p>
            The default, minimal tolerance of 0.0 effectively makes the test
            meaningless, allowing images to "pass" this test without having any
            coverage.  A maximal tolerance of 1.0 will effectively cause every
            image to fail, as it is highly unlikely that a convex hull will
            cover all of its corresponding image.  With a tolerance of 0.25,
            any image whose convex hull covers less than a quarter of the image
            area will "fail" the test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only cubes in both the FROMLIST and CNET are checked.

          Maximum ratio of convex hull coverage to cube area allowed
        </brief>
        <description>
          Given the area of the convex hull, generated from all measures in an
          image, divide by the total area of the image.  The resulting value
          from 0.0 to 1.0 shows roughly what percentage of the image is covered
          by its measures.  If this coverage value is less than the tolerance
          specified by this parameter, then the image will fail the CONVEXHULL
          check and be reported as such.  This value must be between 0.0 and
          1.0, inclusive, and defaults to 0.0.
