  <brief>
    Extracts portions of an existing Control Network
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>Extracts Control Points into a new Control Network from a specified Control
    Network in accordance to specified filters.</p>

    <p>A summary of the Control Points not extracted, listed by the filter which
    prevented them from being extracted, can be included in optional report
    files. See
    the PREFIX and filter keywords for details.</p>

    <p>Currently, the filters are divided into four categories: Exclusive Filters,
    Inclusive Filters, Cube Filters, and Lat/Lon Filters.</p>

    <p>Exclusive Filters prevent extraction. They are taken into consideration
    last and have the highest priority. This means that if any other filter
    creates a selected Exclusive Filter condition during processing, that
    Exclusive Filter will prevent the extraction. For example, if the Cube 
    Filters CUBES, CUBELIST, and CUBEMEASURES are
    used along with the Exclusive Filter NOSINGLEMEASURES, then an input Control
    Point which contains only one cube in the CUBELIST will not be extracted,
    regardless of the number of Control Measures it had on input. This is
    because NOSINGLEMEASURES will see it as a Control Point with exactly one
    Control Measure and prevent its extraction.
    If only Exclusive Filters are used, all Control Points/Measures that do not
    have an exclusive property will be extracted.</p>

    <p>Inclusive Filters allow extraction. They only extract Control Points and/or
    Measures that are included in the Inclusive Filter. In addition, each
    Inclusive Filter is associated with an explicit property of the Control
    Point/Measure. If more than one Inclusive Filter is selected, only Control
    Points/Measures that contain all inclusive properties will be extracted.</p>

    <p>Cube Filters also allow extraction, however, they pertain to the
    cubes contained within the Control Points/Measures. Option RETAIN_REFERENCE 
    will extract the Reference even if not in the Cube List.</p>

    <p>Lat/Lon Filters allow extraction as well, however, they only extract
    Control Points/Measures that lie in the lat/lon bounding box.</p>
