     Correct jitter in input cubes and output corrected undistorted cubes
  </brief>

  <description>
     This application computes angular corrections from pixel offsets in the
     input jitter file and applies the corrections to the undistorted output 
     cube.  This application is procedural in that it runs other applications.
     It runs through a series of applications twice.  The first time it applies 
     the jitter corrections and calculates additional pitch rate and yaw angles 
     to center the remaining camera pointing errors around zero.  The output 
     cube files are deleted and the series of applications is run again, 
     including the additional pitch rate and yaw corrections.

     The first step it performs is to run spiceinit on all the FROMLIST cubes 
     with the parameter attach=no.  A version of the MASTER file is saved and 
     run through the application spicefit to remove noise in the camera 
     pointing.  This file will be used in the noproj runs as the match cube.  
     The next application run is appjit and it needs to load the Spice from the 
     files directly in order have access to Spice information not typically 
     stored on the Isis cube labels. This application applies the corrections 
     from the JITTER file to the camera pointing in the FROMLIST cubes.  Now the 
     FROMLIST cubes are run through noproj, removing the jitter from the pixel 
     positions and the camera distortion.  The results are measured on adjacent
     ccd's by the application hijitreg and used to compute the additional pitch 
     rate and yaw required to center the errors around zero.  

    Now the procedure is repeated with the calculated pitch and yaw passed into 
    appjit as input parameters.  The jitter-reduced and distortion-free output 
    cubes are created by the final set of noproj runs on adjacent ccd's.

          This file is a list of the file specifications for the input cubes all 
          from the save observation and containing pointing errors due to jitter

          This list of output files should contain a file to correspond to each 
          input file.  The output files will have both the jitter removed, as 
          modeled in the input JITTER file, and camera distortions by the 
          application noproj.  The MASTER file with its camera pointing adjusted
          by the application spicefit, will be used as the MATCH file in noproj

            The application appjit applies the jitter corrections to the 
            camera pointing in the MASTER file first and then copies it to the 
            other files in the FROMLIST.  The MASTER file is also used as the
