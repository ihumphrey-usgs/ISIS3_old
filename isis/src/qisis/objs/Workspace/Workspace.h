  * @internal
  * @history  2007-03-21  Tracie Sucharski - Changed call from fitScale to
  *                           fitScaleMinDimension so that the minimum cube
  *                           dimension is displayed in its entirety.
  * @history  2008-05-27  Noah Hilt - Now allows cubes to be
  *           opened with additional arguments read by the
  *           CubeAttributeInput class, specifically to open
  *           certain bands as well as open 3 bands in RGB mode.
  * @history 2008-12-04 Jeannie Walldren - Fixed bug in
  *          addCubeViewport(cubename).  Added exception catch to
  *          addCubeViewport(cube) to close the CubeViewport from
  *          the ViewportMainWindow if it cannot be shown.
  * @history 2009-03-27 Noah Hilt, Steven Lambright - Changed parent class from
  *          QWorkspace to QMdiArea since QWorkspace is now an obsolete class.
  *          Also changed how CubeViewports are created.
  * @history 2010-04-08 Steven Lambright and Eric Hyer - Added progress bar
  * @history 2010-06-26 Eric Hyer - Now uses MdiCubeViewport instead of
  *          CubeViewport.  Also fixed include issues.
  * @history 2010-11-18 Eric Hyer - addBrowseView now deletes the last viewport
  *              in the subWindowList instead of the first one
  * @history 2011-09-19 Steven Lambright - Fixed addBrowseView to actually close
  *                         the old viewports instead of hiding them. Fixes #418
  * @history 2012-05-29 Steven Lambright - Now utilizes ViewportMdiSubWindow instead of
  *                         QMdiSubWindow. References #854.
